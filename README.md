## Getting Started

Install the dependencies using NPM:

```shell
npm install
```

To start developing locally, start the web client by running the `develop` script from the `web` directory:
```shell
cd packages/web
npm run develop
```

Then open another terminal tab and start the cloud function by running the `develop` script from the `server` directory:
```shell
cd packages/server
npm run develop
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the web client.
